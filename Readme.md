# CS:GO case stats viewer V2

## How does it work?

This Java Application loads your whole CS:GO <a href=https://steamcommunity.com/my/inventoryhistory>inventory
history</a> by emulating the load more history button.
To avoid rate limiting it loads 50 transactions (1 Http request) per ~3.5 seconds. Which mean if you have a large
history it will take longer to load.
After the inventory history is dumped you can analyse how many cases you opened.

## Usage

1. Download the latest compiled version as zip via
   the <a href=https://github.com/cantryDev/CSGOCaseStatsViewerV2/releases/latest>latest release tab</a> or compile it
   yourself with maven.
2. Unzip the downloaded zip
3. Execute the execute.ps1 (Right click -> execute with Powershell)
4. Follow the steps in the commandline which just got opened
5. Get disappointed.

## FAQ

### Odds

To simplify the odds each unbox category is treated the same.
For Example a Sticker capsule without Covert Sticker will be treated the same as one with a Covert Sticker.
The difference should be minimal.
